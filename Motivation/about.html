<p><h2><b>ABOUT US<b></h2></p>
<p>As Anthony Robbins put it, “There are two things that motivate us to success: Inspiration or Desperation.</P>
<p>

While operating from inspiration side, we strive to achieve something really great in our life and we are fully dedicated towards that higher goal or purpose.
 In that pleasure of pursuing the higher goal we normally tend to overlook the smaller pains and troubles we face in our day to day lives.</p>
<p>

While operating from desperation side, we strive to get out of something that really bothers us and we are equally committed to work towards something better than what we are today.</p>
<p>In that pursuit of coming out of the pain at present we normally tend to overlook the smaller pains and troubles we face in our day to day lives.


Inspiration or desperation, none of them is fully right or wrong, and no human being is operating completely from inspiration or desperation side. 
We tend to act according to the situations around, 
entirely based on our existing patterns that have been programmed all along our life since childhood.</P>
<p>Either way is appropriate moving towards pleasure or moving away from pain, 
where as people moving towards inspirational goals are widely appreciated by the world around us.


our main goal is to make people think in postive manner. 
It is through motivation that the human resources can be utilized by making full use of it.
