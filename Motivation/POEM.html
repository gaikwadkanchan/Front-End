<font size="10"color=""><b>Send A Drop Of Kindness</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">Send a drop of kindness,<br>
And see a happy face.<br>
A drop of kindness goes real far,<br>
It may even reach outer space.<br><br>

Send a drop of love,<br>
And feel a loving embrace.<br>
It feels so good to feel like,<br>
You are in the right place.<br><br>

Send a drop of hope,<br>
But be that shinning star.<br>
Hope is wonderful to have,<br>
But sometimes you can't sit away so far.<br><br>

Send a drop of faith,<br>
With a single prayer.<br>
And God will show the way,<br>
As faith is always there.</font></p>

<font size="10"color=""><b>When We Share</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">When we share with someone else,<br>
Something valuable to us<br>
You may find out later on,<br>
To them they feel they were blessed.<br><br>

Some of us have lots to give,<br>
And some of us do not.<br>
If someone could benefit,<br>
Why not give them a shot.<br><br>

Sharing is a wonderful thing,<br>
Especially to those you've shared with.<br>
There are a lot of kind people out there,<br>
And that is not a myth.<br><br>

So next time you see someone,<br>
Who could benefit from something you can share.<br>
Don't hold back and look away,<br>
Be kind and answer their prayer.</font></p>

<font size="10"color=""><b>Life Steps
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">Our entire life is made up of choices,<br>
What we decide, the action we take, <br>
the attitude we display<br>
All represent the steps of life.<br><br>

Sometimes we take two steps forward<br>
And one-step back.<br>
Some of us take baby steps<br>
Some of us take giant steps<br><br>

But the secret is not to let that<br>
one step back turn into a failure.<br>
Learn from backward steps<br>
And keep on stepping forward in this dance Called Life! </font></P>

<p align="center">
<font size="10"color=""><b>Allow Yourself To Fight </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">There are some days you may feel,<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">As if things just aren't going right.<br>
No amount of attempts to avoid,<br>
You step into the big mud puddle despite! <br><br>

On these days to give up would be easy,<br>
You'd like to just walk away.<br>
And sometimes taking a step back,<br>
May be exactly the right way.<br><br>

But at a point you'll have to decide,<br>
If you're going to let them win.<br>
This is the time that you'll look deep inside,<br>
And see if you have it within.<br><br>

When you are ready to take the next step,<br>
And show that you are ready to fight.<br>
Avoid what you can and it's okay if you can't,<br>
Cause know matter what, you'll be all right.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="10"color=""><b>Each Day Is A Chance</b></font></p> 
<p align="center"><font size="5"color="">
Each day we wake up,<br>
We have another chance.<br>
We could just keep on moving,<br>
Or we could decide to dance.<br><br>

Dance as if you are alone,<br>
And no one will ever see,<br>
As this is your chance,<br>
To see what you could be.<br><br>

Remind yourself you are someone,<br>
Someone who is grand.<br>
Believe you can do anything,<br>
Get up and take a stand.<br><br>

Always keep looking forward,<br>
Looking back is never good.<br>
You want to look to the future,</font></p>
